# Traffic sign recognition
Implementing a real-time traffic sign recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) holds immense importance across various domains such as Autonomous Vehicles, Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), Smart Surveillance Systems, Industrial Automation, Robotics
Their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from images makes them well-suited for tasks like traffic sign recognition
Real-time traffic sign recognition includes challenges such as speed,accuracy,robustness.
CNNs are highly relevant in traffic sign recognition tasks due to their capability to automatically learn discriminative features from images, minimizing errors in detection
